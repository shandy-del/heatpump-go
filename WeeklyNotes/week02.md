# Questions from Last Week (Still Unresolved)
1. **Should each page provide direct user feedback such as:**
Estimated ROI (time spent vs. lifetime savings)? Learn X mins ‚Üí Save ¬£Y lifetime
Real-time or monthly electricity cost tracking?
Progress indication within the heat pump learning journey (e.g., Novice ‚Üí Advanced)?
**Follow-up Considerations:**
**Feasibility:** Electricity tracking may require smart meter integration or user-provided utility data.
**Motivational value:** ROI-style feedback and learning progress gamification can help improve user retention and encourage deeper engagement.
**Privacy:** Since the website does not collect user data, feedback must be generated without storing personal information ‚Äî possibly using local/session storage.

2. **Should we personalize learning paths beyond home type?**
e.g., based on user goals: cost savings / sustainability / comfort?
Could a short optional quiz classify users into different learning personas?

3. **Which pages require internationalization or localization support?**
Should we prepare for multi-language support at this stage?
What terms (e.g., ‚ÄúFlat‚Äù vs. ‚ÄúApartment‚Äù) vary across UK audiences?

4. **Do we need a dedicated accessibility review (a11y)?**
Check ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, color contrast, etc.
Especially important for diagram-heavy, interactive content.
Next Steps (To do this week)

# Next Steps (To do this week)
1. Design 4 distinct UI prototypes for the learning journey
2. Finish database structure and connect it with Spring Boot backend

# Design 4 distinct UI prototypes
[View 4 Prototypes on Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/FYXBRrEyK2Uux0yu9Oj5cN/Heatpump-01?node-id=46-331&t=7TpZ9SOAYtvYOPCr-1)

**goal:** 
To build an **interactive, visual-first website** that helps users with different levels of understanding learn about heat pumps and improve the efficiency of their home usage. The site follows a **"learning journey"** concept, guiding users through personalized paths to quickly access relevant knowledge.

## 1. Spiral Learning Journey Map
- Displays a floating spiral path with distributed knowledge blocks (nodes) along the journey. Spiral and nodes can include soft shadows or float-style animation (via Smart Animate).
- Users can scroll or drag along the path; clicking a node opens detailed content.
- Inspiration: Museum-style learning maps + Doodle Jump-like visual mood.

### 1.1 Core Layout and Navigation
1. **Spiral Structure:**
Knowledge points are distributed along a spiral path, representing different learning stages.
2. **Color Legend:**
A sidebar legend explains the user category of each node:</br>
üü° Beginner
üîµ Heat Pump User
üî¥ Troubleshooting
‚ö´ Government Support

### 1.2 Node Interactions
1. **Hover Effect:**<br>
When the user hovers over a knowledge node:
- The node becomes brighter and enlarged.
- It signals that the node is interactive.
2. **Click Action:**<br>
Each knowledge node supports two types of behavior: 
- Display Overlay ‚Äì A floating card shows detailed knowledge content.
- Navigate to Frame ‚Äì Jumps to a separate knowledge detail page.

### 1.3 Search + Auto Focus
**Search Bar:**
- Users can enter a question or keyword (e.g., Why is my electricity bill high?)
- The spiral zooms in and centers on the relevant knowledge node.

### 1.4 View Mode Switch: Bird View ‚Üî Step View
1. **Bird View (default):**
- Top-down overview of the spiral and all topics.
2. **Step View:**
- Switches to a first-person perspective.
- The camera follows the spiral path, one node at a time.
- Ideal for immersive storytelling and focused learning.

### 1.5 Progress Tracking
- **Viewed Topic Indicator:** <br>
After a user views a topic, nodes can change color (e.g., dim or glow).
- **Progress Summary:**<br>
Displayed below the spiral: ```Progress: 6/12 topics viewed (50%)```<br>
Encourages full completion of the learning journey.

## 2. Quiz-based Interactive Heat Pump Machine Model
- A 3D interactive model of a heat pump (and optionally, house cross-section).
- User can zoom in/out, rotate, and click on components to learn their function.
- Visual interaction inspired by Apple product pages, possibly WebGL or lightweight AR.
- References: NY Clean Heat Planner: a great example of step-by-step guidance and heat pump matching.

### 2.1 User Pathways (Homepage Entry)
On the homepage, users are directed to one of three learning journeys through clear buttons:
1. **Pre-Installation Guide**<br>
For users who haven‚Äôt installed a heat pump and want to learn about preparation and selection.
2. **Troubleshooting**<br>
For users experiencing issues with their current heat pump.
3. **Efficiency Optimization**<br>
For users who already use heat pumps and want to improve performance.
Each button takes the user to a separate interactive page.

### 2.2 Interactive Map in Pre-Installation Path
- A 3D community map inspired by the city of Bristol is placed at the center of the page.
- Iconic buildings and streets guide users to click on different home types (Detached, Terraced, etc.).
- This creates a sense of neighborhood exploration and helps users visually select their home type.

### 2.3 Home Type Page (e.g., Detached)
- A 3D model of the house is shown, with interactive outdoor features like garden and driveway.
- The page opens with a guiding message:<br>
‚ÄúHelp us recommend a suitable heat pump for your home.‚Äù
- Users answer a few quick questions:<br>
How many bedrooms does your home have?<br>
Do you have a private outdoor space?<br>
What is your current heating system?<br>
- As the user answers, the 3D model updates in real-time (e.g., adding more rooms or a garden).
- Zoom and focus tools let users "enter" the house to explore details.
Users can:<br>
```
1. Click on windows to learn about insulation advice.
2. Click on walls for renovation suggestions.
3. Click on the heat pump to learn about core parts and how it works.
```
Each click provides a deeper layer of understanding, similar to exploring a game world.

### 2.4 Recommendation Results Page
After clicking ‚ÄúShow My Recommendation,‚Äù users are directed to a results page that:
- Presents the recommended heat pump type (air source, ground source, hybrid).
- Displays images and text describing the suggested solution.
- Explains why this solution fits the user‚Äôs situation (e.g., ‚ÄúYour home has a garden and 3 bedrooms...‚Äù).
- Provides a button to explore more about the specific pump type.

### 2.5 Navigation and Page Structure
- All pages include a breadcrumb trail, for example:<br>
```Home > Pre-Installation > Choose the Type of Your Home > Detached```<br>
This helps users know where they are and navigate back easily.
- Some pages reuse the same layout and logic, only changing content based on the user‚Äôs path.

### 2.6 Technical and Interaction Tips
- Visual hints such as ‚ÄúTry to zoom in/out‚Äù help guide the user.
- Smooth scroll and layered page design ensure a fluid experience.
- All animations and feedback use soft transitions for a pleasant interaction.

## 3. Duduo Bird / Quiz Game Style (Brilliant.org-inspired)
- A gamified step-by-step quiz system where users explore topics through micro challenges and instant feedback.
- Suitable for guiding users through decision logic (e.g., which heat pump suits you).

## 4. Realistic Community Map Interface
- A map view showing the city of Bristol, with clickable houses representing different home types.
- Designed to feel like a local guide; paths from city center lead to various household profiles.
- Users choose home type visually, then proceed to customization and learning.



# Database structure and Backend Development
See project **heatpump-backend** in VS Code for full implementation details.
Database tables are designed and managed in DataGrip, under the schema **heatpump**.
