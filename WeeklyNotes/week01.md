# Project Overview
## Goal
Help UK residents improve the efficiency of their heat pump usage.

## Research Topics of Week 01
### 1. How Heat Pumps Work
- Principles of operation
- System components
- Factors affecting efficiency

#### 1.1 What Exactly Is a Heat Pump?
- <b>Not a heater but a "heat mover": Transfers free thermal energy from air/ground into your home</b>
- run on electricity
- three to four times more efficient than other heating systems, including other electric heating systems--storage heaters, electric radiators and electric boilers

#### 1.2 How Heat Pump Work: The Physics

Outdoor Unit->>Evaporator: Absorbs ambient heat
Evaporator->>Compressor: Gas compression (temp ↑)
Compressor->>Condenser: Releases heat indoors
Condenser->>Expansion Valve: Pressure drop (temp ↓)
Expansion Valve->>Evaporator: Cycle repeats

#### 1.2 Installation cost



### 2. What Is a Learning Journey?
- A structured, phased approach to guiding users through knowledge
- Helps personalize learning based on user needs and entry point

### 3. Initial Website Prototype
- Designed and implemented the homepage
- Introduced core visual structure and content layout
- Set up modular sections for future learning content

#### 3.1 Planned Content Structure
1. Core Knowledge Base: </br>Foundational concepts and how heat pumps work
2. Efficiency Optimization Guide: </br>Strategies for smarter, more efficient heat pump use
3. Daily Operation Handbook: </br>Practical usage, safety, maintenance etc. tips
4. Self-Diagnosis Center: </br>Quick guides for troubleshooting common problems
5. UK Resources Hub: </br>Localized support including subsidies, installers, climate guidance, etc.
