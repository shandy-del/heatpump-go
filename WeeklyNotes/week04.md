# Next Steps (To do this week)
1. Create survey containing qualitative and quantitative questions (before end of the Wedensday), and send it to my supervisor
2. Prepare for Friday's online meeting
3. Thesis: related work--browsing existing heat pump websites / portals and listing for each purpose how different websites presents information

## Part 2: Task-Based Evaluation

Instructions:
You will now test four website designs (Designs A–D). Please complete the following tasks for each design in random order, providing immediate feedback after each task.

Task 1: You want to learn about common types of heat pumps.

Usability rating for each design:
(1: Unable to complete; 2: Very difficult, many attempts; 3: Some difficulty, eventually completed; 4: Easy with minor issues; 5: Extremely easy, no issues)

Design A:
Usability rating: □ 1 □ 2 □ 3 □ 4 □ 5
Were you able to find the information you needed? □ Yes □ No
Design B:
Usability rating: □ 1 □ 2 □ 3 □ 4 □ 5
Were you able to find the information you needed? □ Yes □ No
Design C:
Usability rating: □ 1 □ 2 □ 3 □ 4 □ 5
Were you able to find the information you needed? □ Yes □ No
Design D:
Usability rating: □ 1 □ 2 □ 3 □ 4 □ 5
Were you able to find the information you needed? □ Yes □ No
Confidence rating:
How confident are you in the accuracy of the information you found in this task?
(1 = Not confident at all → 5 = Completely confident)

Preference ranking for this task:
Rank the designs based on your preference specifically for this task (1st = best, 4th = worst):

□ Design A
□ Design B
□ Design C
□ Design D
Briefly explain why your top choice appealed most to you:

(Repeat the same structure for Tasks 2–4, changing only the task description):

Task 2: You want to know which type of heat pump suits your home best.

Task 3: You want to discover what kind of government support is available for heat pump installation.

Task 4: Imagine your installed heat pump is making unusual noises. You want to learn how to resolve this issue.

## 第三部分：整体评估
1. 综合来说，请你对4个原型进行偏好排序
