# Next Steps (To do this week)
1. Create high-fidelity designs for four distinct prototypes
2. Prepare for user study

# Hi-Fi designs for four distinct prototypes
[View 4 Prototypes on Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/FYXBRrEyK2Uux0yu9Oj5cN/Heatpump-01?node-id=46-331&t=7TpZ9SOAYtvYOPCr-1)

# Preparation for user study
## I. User Evaluation Survey: HeatPumpGo Prototypes
### Part 1: Satisfaction Rating (1–5 Likert Scale)
(1 = Strongly Disagree / 5 = Strongly Agree)

Please rate the following for each prototype:

| Statement                                      | Rating (1–5) |
|-----------------------------------------------|--------------|
| The prototype was easy to use.                | -            |
| The content was easy to understand.           | -            |
| The visual design was appealing.              | -            |
| Exploring the information was enjoyable.      | -            |
| I would be willing to use this design regularly. | -         |

### Part 2: Multiple Choice
Please choose the prototype that best fits each description:
1. Which prototype is most suitable for beginners?
   - Spiral Learning Journey
   - Quiz-Based Interactive
   - Doodle Jump Game
   - Knowledge Bubbles
2. Which prototype is best for visual learners?
   - Spiral Learning Journey
   - Quiz-Based Interactive
   - Doodle Jump Game
   - Knowledge Bubbles
3. Which prototype feels too complex or information-dense?
   - Spiral Learning Journey
   - Quiz-Based Interactive
   - Doodle Jump Game
   - Knowledge Bubbles
4. Which prototype feels most like a fun product rather than a traditional website?
   - Spiral Learning Journey
   - Quiz-Based Interactive
   - Doodle Jump Game
   - Knowledge Bubbles

### Part 3: Open Questions
Please answer in your own words:
1. Which prototype did you like the most, and why?
2. Was there any prototype where you felt confused or lost? What happened?
3. Is there anything you'd like to add or improve in any of the prototypes?

## II. Use Evaluation tools: Qualitative / Quantitative Evaluation 
1. Qualitative
- Heuristic Evaluation
- Think-Aloud Protocol
2. Quantitative
- SUS (System Usability Scale)
- NASA-TLX
